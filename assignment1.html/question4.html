    <ul>
        <li>My name is Ayush kumar </li>
        <li>I am a B-Tech 2nd year student 

        </li>
        <li> My goal is to become a software devloper </li>
        <li>I never give up until I finish something</li>
        <li>I get on well with all kinds of people</li>
        <li>I am good to those I care about</li>

    </ul>
    <p> I have always enjoyed working with people from different backgrounds and experiences than myself, which is why I would love to continue learning about how your company does things and how you approach challenges.</p>
    <p>I believe that my work ethic, attention to detail, and willingness to learn new skills complement each other exceptionally well. Furthermore, my ability to work independently without supervision has been instrumental in developing these skills.</p>
    <p>My favorite thing about programming is how it lets me express myself creativelyâ€”I love coming up with ways to communicate what I want to say with code instead of words or pictures.</p>
